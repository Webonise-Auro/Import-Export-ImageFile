# Import-Export-ImageFile

This vbo will help us in loading image files into the data item, so that we can perform further operations on it.

I have used this vbo for loading image to the data item while working with Google Cloud Vision. Input parameter for the "Text Extraction " action is Image type, so we need to load local image file to data item of type image.
